# Storytelling-with-Tableau
Project 8 of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) https://public.tableau.com/profile/tamunotonye.harry#!/

# Project Description
For this project, you will create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

# Project Specification
- Visualization is Explanatory
- Design
- Feedback

**Visualization is Explanatory**

*Does the visualization have a clear finding?*
- The visualization centers on a specific, clear finding in the data.

*Does the visualization focus on its finding?*
- The selected finding is clearly communicated. Design choices foster communication between the reader and the visualization.


**Design**

*Does the written summary reflect what a reader would interpret from the graphic?*
- A readerâ€™s summary of the graphic would closely match the written summary in the writeup, or a reader would identify at least one main point or relationship that the graphic attempts to convey.

*Does the data visualization incorporate interaction or animation?*
- The visualization includes interaction or animation. The interaction or animation may be simple, such as a hover, tooltip, or transition. Interaction or animation enhances understanding of the data.

*Are initial design decisions documented?*
- Initial design decisions such as chart type, visual encodings, layout, legends, or hierarchy are included at the beginning of the Design section in the writeup.


**Feedback**

*Has feedback been collected after sharing the initial visualization? We encourage you to collect feedback from the first sketch to the final visualization.*
- Feedback has been collected from at least one person throughout the process of creating the data visualization. The feedback is documented in the Feedback section of the writeup.

*Has feedback been used to improve and iterate on the visualization? If not, does the project explain why the design of the visualization did not change?*
- The project includes evidence that the visualization has been improved since the first sketch or the first coded version of the visualization. All of the feedback is listed in the Feedback section of the writeup. Most design choices and changes are accounted for in the Design section of the writeup. If no changes were made to the visualization after gathering feedback, this decision is explained.
